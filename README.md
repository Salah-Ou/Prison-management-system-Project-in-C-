# Prison-management-system-Project-in-C++

<p>The <span class="highlight">Prison Management System</span> is a console-based application developed in <span class="highlight">C++</span> to facilitate
the efficient management of prison operations. This system provides a user-friendly interface for handling prisoner records, managing cell assignments, and
maintaining essential prison-related data securely and systematically.</p>

<h2>Key Features</h2>

<h3>1. User Authentication</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Secure login system with username and password.</li>
  <li>Ensures only authorized personnel can access the system.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Prisoner Management</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>New Prisoner Entry:</strong> Add detailed records of new prisoners, including personal information, crime details, and cell allocation.</li>
  <li><strong>Prisoner Details:</strong> View a list of all prisoners with comprehensive information such as name, age, gender, crime, penalty period, and assigned cell.</li>
  <li><strong>Attendance:</strong> Record and view prisoner attendance by their assigned cell number.</li>
  <li><strong>Release Prisoner:</strong> Remove records of released prisoners from the system.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Search Functionality</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Search for prisoners by name and retrieve their details quickly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Data Export</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Save prisoner records to a text file for offline storage or reporting purposes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Interactive Menu</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Intuitive menu-driven interface for easy navigation and access to system functionalities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Programming Language:</strong> C++</li>
  <li><strong>Windows-Specific Libraries:</strong> Used for cursor positioning (<code>gotoxy</code>) and color-coded text for enhanced UI.</li>
  <li><strong>File Handling:</strong> Persistent storage of prisoner data in text files.</li>
  <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong> Modular design using classes and encapsulation for better scalability.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>The system aims to digitize and streamline prison management, replacing traditional manual processes. It ensures data accuracy, enhances security, and provides a centralized platform for prison staff to manage daily operations efficiently.</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Dynamic UI:</strong> Enhanced user experience with color-coded output and real-time clock display.</li>
  <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Alerts for invalid inputs and unavailable cells.</li>
  <li><strong>Secure Access:</strong> Password-protected login to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Applications</h2>
  <p>This project is ideal for small to medium-sized correctional facilities and can be further expanded for larger institutions by incorporating advanced features like database integration and biometric authentication.</p>
